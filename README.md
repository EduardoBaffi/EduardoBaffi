# Hi! I`m Eduardo Baffi

I`m a Data Analyst who worked in audit in the energy sector for several years and now undertakes a new challenge towards Data Science. 

I have just finished a Data Science Bootcamp which provided me the skills needed to perform capture, preprocessing, data storage, analysis, and visualization using Python, Machine Learning, MySQL and Kibana. These skills, as well as the experience gained from several years in audit and energy, are essential to undertake a new challenge as data analyst.
